### From fastq to SNP Annotation
The variant calling pipeline identifies single nucleotide variants present within whole genome sequence data. The variants are identified by comparing the datasets of an individual with a reference sequence. The variant calling pipeline consists of a series of interlinked sequential steps
#### Steps

Dedubplication
Local Realignment Around Indels 
Variant Calling
